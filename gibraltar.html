                  <p>The storyline of Loba</p>
							</header>
							<p>&quot;My world was shattered that day. And my path was now a fog of unknowns. The system tried to erase the tragedy, but some wounds are too deep to ever truly heal. I've always felt it in my blood. I am a thief. And a good one at that. It was the only way I felt true to myself. And those same feelings grew into opportunity. I honed my skills, and enhanced my methods. With success came wealth, power, and friendship. I was the best, and everyone knew it. But something was always missing.&quot;</p>

							<p>When Loba was nine, she looked on as simulacrum hitman Revenant killed her family. Left with nothing, Loba was given to a foster family. But like her mother and father, she quickly found out she was good at being a thief. She started with picking pockets and as her skills improved, Loba used every tool at her disposal to lift herself from the gutter. Everything changed when she broke into a supposedly impenetrable facility and got her hands on the Jump Drive tech stored inside. With her new teleportation bracelet, the most secure and unattainable items were within her reach. So was her dream of living the high life.</p>

							<p>Rumors spread across the Outlands: if you wanted something valuable -and well guarded- Loba's who you go to. She was almost able to put her past behind her. But when Revenant joined the Games, her past catapulted into her future. Desperate to find a way to kill him, she found out the truth about the Simulacrum with help from her friend Jaime and successfully sabotaged a facility full of Revenant bodies, bringing Skull Town and Thunderdome crashing down in the process. However, she learned it was just one of many such factories hidden across the Frontier. Now, she's joined the Games to find a way to end him for good. It doesn't hurt that the Arenas are brimming with treasures just waiting to be plucked. </p>
                            
                            <p>Revenge will come, if fortune favors her. In the meantime, some shiny things have caught her eye.</p>
