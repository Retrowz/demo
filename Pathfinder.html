							<p>&quot;I’m Marvin, but my best friends call me Pathfinder. I love being an Apex Legend because that means my banner is on display for everyone in the Outlands to see, especially my creator whoever they are. Competing alongside so many skilled fighters each match is really cool and it makes me very excited to know that I am everyone’s favorite squadmate to fight with; my friend Mirage told me that. He also said that I don’t get sarcasm, which was also nice to hear...I think.&quot;</p>

							<p>Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (<strong>M</strong>obile <strong>R</strong>obotic <strong>V</strong>ersatile e<strong>N</strong>tity) modified to specialize in location scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an abandoned laboratory with no idea who created him or why. With only his MRVN designation to hint at his identity, Pathfinder set off in search of his creator.</p>

							<p>Pathfinder has learned much in his travels since then (like how to make a mean Eastern Leviathan Stew) but hasn't come any closer to finding his creator. Still, he's never given up hope, and took odd jobs in order to gain information about his maker. It was during a chance meeting with bartender Elliott Witt in Solace City that he learned about the Apex Games.[1] Wishing to gain a following—and hopefully draw the attention of his maker, he joined the popular bloodsport. In the meantime, he remains enthusiastic and helpful, always ready to make new friends (then shoot them). </p>
