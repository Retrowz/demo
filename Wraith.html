								<p>The Storyline Of Wraith</p>
								<h2>Wraith</h2>
							</header>
							<p>&quot;I've seen a world where I'm not a Legend... and I've seen a world where I am. We all make choices in our lives, every second, every day, and those choices... they define us, but they don't control us. We are our future, not our past. No matter what choice you make, the world you're in is the world you chose... Accept it. One day you're a Legend, the next you're something else. So be it, nothing will control me.&quot;</p>

							<p>Subject 61137, Codenamed "Wraith", is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute swift and deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric of reality. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC Detention Facility for the Mentally Ill with no memory of her life before. She also began hearing a distant voice whispering in her mind that would keep her awake for days on end, nearly driving her insane.</p>

							<p>She was in the facility one day when a portal opened before she was to be sedated. A person wearing a purple helmet came out, scaring the facility staff away. The person berated her for not fighting back and revealed herself to Wraith. She was her from another dimension, on a quest for revenge on the people who experimented on her. With this Voidwalker's help, she learned to trust the voices and was given the device needed for her to safely manipulate the void.</p>
                            
                            <p>Using a portal to the Voidwalker's dimension enabled her to escape her facility, arriving in Kings Canyon - still under construction for the Apex Games. Determined to uncover her true identity, Wraith began a quest to find out more about the experiments and herself. Many of the old research facilities, however, are buried beneath the heavily guarded arenas used for the Apex Games. She now returns to where she arrived in this world and joined the competition, and with every match, she gets closer to the truth.</p>
